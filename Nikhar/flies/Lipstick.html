    <p>Another pretty product from Lakme, this lipcolor is a winner. This color can be worn for college and office without any fear of inappropriateness ;) Peach Carnation is a misnomer, though. The Lakme matte lipstick color is more of a pinkish brown and leans more towards greas.</p>

The only complaint is that it settles into fine lines after 3 hours, but that is so okay with the pretty color right? ;)</p>
